# PLATFORM BUILD LOG

This document records the execution progress of the platform build plan.

Each completed build must be logged here immediately after successful implementation and commit.

The purpose of this log is to ensure deterministic development and prevent AI coding agents from rebuilding or modifying completed modules unintentionally.

---

# BUILD STATUS

Total Builds Planned: 150

Completed Builds: 5  
Next Build: 6

Current Phase: Phase 2 — Audit & Governance Core

---

# BUILD EXECUTION RULES

When completing a build:

1. Implement the subsystem defined in `build_plan.md`.
2. Verify that the implementation follows the referenced architecture section.
3. Test the implementation locally.
4. Commit code using the build number in the commit message.
5. Update this log with the completed build entry.
6. Increment the "Completed Builds" counter.

Example commit message:

Build 26 — Session Start API implemented

## Build 1 — Platform Initialization

Phase  
Phase 1 — Platform Foundation

Summary  
Initialized the platform development environment and infrastructure.

Components implemented:

- Firebase project setup
- Firestore database initialization
- Cloud Functions TypeScript project
- Firebase Hosting configuration
- Emulator Suite configuration
- Monorepo folder structure
- Admin portal React application
- Git repository initialization
- GitHub repository connection

Development environments configured:

- Linux development machine
- Windows development machine

Result  
Platform infrastructure is operational and ready for subsystem development.

## Build 2 — Environment Configuration System

Phase  
Phase 1 — Platform Foundation

Summary  
Implemented a centralized backend environment configuration loader for Cloud Functions.

Components implemented:

- Strongly typed environment configuration interfaces
- Runtime NODE_ENV validation with allowed environment values
- Required PROJECT_ID validation
- Centralized service endpoint loading for APP_BASE_URL, EXAM_BASE_URL, and VENDOR_BASE_URL
- Optional secret loading for Stripe, AI, and email provider credentials
- Structured startup logging of non-sensitive configuration state

Result  
Backend runtime configuration is now loaded through a single validated module suitable for local and production environments.

## Build 3 — Secret Management

Phase  
Phase 1 — Platform Foundation

Summary  
Implemented a centralized backend secret resolution layer for Cloud Functions.

Components implemented:

- Typed secret metadata and runtime secret interfaces
- Local development secret loading from `.env` and environment variables
- Production secret resolution through Google Secret Manager
- Structured logging of secret source metadata without exposing secret values
- Secret lookup caching per runtime environment and project
- `.env` repository protection with a tracked `.env.example` template

Result  
Backend services now resolve API, email, and payment secrets through a deterministic secret management layer that keeps production secrets outside the repository.

## Build 4 — Structured Logging System

Phase  
Phase 1 — Platform Foundation

Summary  
Implemented a centralized structured logging system for Cloud Functions runtime services.

Components implemented:

- Typed structured logger with enforced log levels
- Automatic requestId generation and HTTP request context capture
- Standard log metadata including timestamp, environment, service, and version
- Recursive sensitive-field redaction for structured payloads
- Production DEBUG suppression and Google Cloud Logging compatible emission
- Integration into current runtime configuration, secret management, and HTTP health check paths

Result  
Backend foundation services now emit consistent structured logs suitable for Google Cloud Logging analysis and request-level traceability.

## Build 5 — Runtime Error Reporting

Phase  
Phase 1 — Platform Foundation

Summary  
Implemented a centralized runtime error reporting layer for Cloud Functions.

Components implemented:

- Typed runtime error reporting interfaces and metadata contracts
- Centralized Google Cloud Error Reporting-compatible reporter service
- Automatic error reporting from structured logger `error` and `critical` calls
- Global `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` process handlers
- Request-aware error metadata including requestId, environment, service, version, and feature flag state

Result  
Backend foundation services now emit centralized runtime failure reports with deployment metadata and request traceability for observability and crash diagnosis.

# BUILD HISTORY POLICY

Completed builds must **never be rewritten** unless:

- architecture document changes require migration
- security vulnerability requires patch
- explicit build revision is documented

If a revision is required:

- create a new entry  
- reference the original build number  
- describe the change

Example:

Build 26 Revision 1 — Fixed session token validation

---

# AI EXECUTION NOTICE

AI coding agents must always read the following documents before generating code:

1. `build_plan.md`
2. `build_log.md`
3. `architecture_rules.md`
4. `3_Core_Architectures.md`

The agent must implement **only the next pending build** and must not modify previously completed builds.
